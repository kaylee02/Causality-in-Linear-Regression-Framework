* Introduction
When running a program or a campaign, as a producer, we all want to measure the impact and predict the future effects of the program. Likewise, if we are to resolve a problem or situation, we tend to search for the root cause and consider relations between various influential factors. Causality is about answering these questions using data and that is what we are about to do with the progresa program data.

# Technologies
* R
* tidyverse
* ML and basic statistics knowledge
